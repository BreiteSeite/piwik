# Screenshots UI tests

Piwik contains UI tests that work by taking a screenshot of a URL and comparing it with
an expected screenshot. If any screenshots do not match, the build will fail.
These screenshots are taken after each commit to our git repository.
This powerful tool, which we call continuous User Interface tests, enables Piwik to remain stable and innovate faster.

## Using screenshots tests

As a Piwik developer, you may make changes to Piwik User interface.
When you change some CSS or visuals, it may make the Travis UI Test go from green to red.
We have tried to make fixing the build easy, please read below how to fix the screenshot build:

**As a Piwik developer, how do I fix UI tests build?**

 * If the piwik-ui-tests travis build has failed, go to travis: [https://travis-ci.org/piwik/piwik-ui-tests](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/piwik-ui-tests)
 * Click on the latest failed build.
 * In the output for this build, you will find a message such as:
     http://builds-artifacts.piwik.org/ui-tests.master/1617.1/screenshot-diffs/diffviewer.html
 * Visit this URL. It lists all screenshots which have changed in your commit.
 * Check that the changes are desired. Sometimes we introduce regression without realising, and screenshot tests can help us spot such regressions.
     * If the change is not wanted, revert or fix your commit.
     * If the change is wanted, then you can set the new screenshots as the expected screenshot.
       To do so, in the diffviewer.html page click on the "Processed" link for this screenshot.
       Then "Save this file as" and save it in the piwik/tests/PHPUnit/UI/expected-ui-screenshots/ directory.
 * Push the changes (to your code and/or to the expected-ui-screenshots directory.
 * Wait for next UI Tests build [on travis](https://travis-ci.org/piwik/piwik-ui-tests). Hopefully, the build should be green!


## Setup screenshots tests on your dev box

These tests are in another repository but are included in Piwik as a submodule. To get the tests, run the following commands:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

In order to run UI tests, you need to have [phantomjs](http://phantomjs.org) version 1.9.0 or greater
installed on your machine. You can download phantomjs [here](http://phantomjs.org/download.html). phantomjs is headless, so even if you're on a server without the X window system, you can still run the
UI tests.

On Ubuntu:

    $ sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer imagemagick imagemagick-doc

To generate screenshots identical to those generated by Travis, we install some extra fonts. 

Imagick is used to generate the "difference" screenshots which show which pixels have changed.

Removing this font may be useful if your generated screenshots' fonts do not match the expected screenshots:

    $ sudo apt-get remove ttf-bitstream-vera

## Running Tests

You can test the UI by running:

    $ cd PHPUnit
    $ phpunit --group UI
